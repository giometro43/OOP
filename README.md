  - Pretty excited, so to make things easier, here is a walkthrough on version control and updating via Egit
  
  **Youtube Video tutorial:** [EGit Plugin in Eclipse IDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZw9p6yN6QQ)
- Allows you to make git commits via Eclipse using the EGit Eclipse plugin


-   **If you encounter issues with credential input for GitHub in Egit, this is due to the inability to prompt for MFA if enabled in github**
  -  In that case, ***generate a personal token*** from the GitHub settings, and ***input it as the password field in Egit***
