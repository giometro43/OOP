The Toyota Camry (XV40) is a mid-size car produced by Toyota from January 2006 to October 2011. 
Replacing the XV30 series, the XV40 represented the sixth generation of the Toyota Camry in all 
markets outside Japan, which followed a different generational lineage. Between 2006 and 2010,
a badge engineered model called Daihatsu Altis sold alongside the Camry in Japan. 
Toyota replaced the XV40 series in 2011 with the XV50.
Introduced at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show, 
the XV40 made its North American sales debut in March 2006 as a 2007 model. 
For the first time, a gasoline/electric hybrid version of Camry was offered in 
addition to the naturally aspirated four- and six-cylinder engines.
Like the previous XV30 model, the XV40 was offered in two distinct forms. 
The Camry sold in Australasia and North America was the same as the version available in Japan; 
the version sold in China and the majority of Southeast Asia was based 
on the Australian-designed XV40 Aurion. 
The Aurion was essentially the same as the regular Camry, albeit, with revised front- 
and rear-end styling, and minor alterations to the interior.
