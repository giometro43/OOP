The Honda K-series engine is a line of four-cylinder four-stroke car engines introduced in 2001. 
The K-series engines are equipped with DOHC valvetrains and use roller rockers on the cylinder 
head to reduce friction. The engines use a coil-on-plug, distributorless ignition system with a 
coil for each spark plug. This system forgoes the use of a conventional distributor-based ignition 
timing system in favor of a computer-controlled system that allows the ECU to control ignition 
timings based on various sensor inputs. The cylinders have cast iron sleeves similar to the B- 
and F-series engines, as opposed to the FRM cylinders found in the H- and newer F-series engines 
found only in the Honda S2000.
Similar to B series, the K-series car engines have two short blocks with the same design; 
the only difference between them being the deck height. K20 uses the short block with a deck 
height of 212 mm (8.3 in) where K23 and K24 block has a deck height of 231.5 mm (9.1 in).[1]
Two versions of the Honda i-VTEC system can be found on a K-series engine, 
and both versions can come with variable timing control (VTC) on the intake cam. 
The VTEC system on engines like the K20A3 only operate on the intake cam; at low rpm only one 
intake valve is fully opened, the other opening just slightly to create a swirl effect in the 
combustion chamber for improved fuel atomization.
