/*Requirements: Read a positive number n from the keyboard. Compute the following terms both by addition and applying the formula:
Sum of numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n;
Sum of numbers formula: n*(n+1)/2;
In the following ones we mark the power with ^, so 2^3 is 2 power 3 or 2*2*2 = 8;
Sum of squares: 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + n^2;
Sum of squares formula: ( 2*(n^3) + 3*(n^2) + n) / 6;
Sum of cubes: 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + ... + n^3;
Sum of cubes formula: ( n^4 + 2*(n^3) + n^2) / 4. Also compute the following product of numbers, named factorial:
m! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * m as a big integer. Print all the results. https://youtu.be/RPgoiLXxKkY */
