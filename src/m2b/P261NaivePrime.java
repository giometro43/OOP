/** REQUIREMENTS:
 * Given a number n in the command line, compute and print all the prime numbers less or equal with n.
 * Use a naive method to test for each number k from 2 to n if it is prime.
 * The test will consider all numbers from 2 to k-1 and see if they are divisors of k.
 * If none is, then the number is prime.
 * Print the numbers as identified 10 per line.
 * Compute the execution time for the entire program.
