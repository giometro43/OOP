/** REQUIREMENTS:
 * Imagine a game, in which the computer creates girl teams of soccer players
 * to simulate a tournament in which the user will participate.
 * The program reads a list of 100 possible names (first names) of girls from a file,
 * that is explicitly specified in the program. It stores the names in an array of Strings,
 * and prints the names separated by a space in the console.
 * Then asks the user to provide a number of teams and team sizes
 * and randomly prints teams with that number of players.
